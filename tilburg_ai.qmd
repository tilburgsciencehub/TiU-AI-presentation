## Future Vision for Universities 

- Algorithmic approach to course allocation
- Personalized studying experience
- Budget allocation to course developers and teachers
- Automated scheduling based on predicted attendance
- Summarized lectures and slide decks for otherwise engaged students
- Professors can focus on coaching and developing new ideas
- AI technology revolutionizes higher education

# Agenda & Purpose

1.  What is AI?
2.  How do we already use AI?
3.  What are new ways in which we can use it?
4.  How to get AI-ready?


## Who am I?
- [Hannes Datta](https://hannesdatta.com); Assocociate Prof. at TiU since 2013
- Working in marketing research, studying digital markets
- Passion for innovation (e.g., TestVision, Blended Learning, [Tilburg Young Academy](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/onderzoek/tilburg-young-academy), [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com))

. . .

**Disclaimer**

- Not an AI researcher (but: I love technology!)
- Researcher from TiSEM (but: talked to 10+ faculty members across schools)
- Focus on AI &rarr; University (not: AI &rarr; workplaces)

# 1. What's AI <br>(and what it's not)?{background-color="#036"}

## AI is everywhere

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
__In daily life__

- Navigation (e.g., Google Maps)
- Face recognition (e.g., iPhone)
- Voice assistants (e.g., Alexa)
- Search and recommendation (e.g. Bol.com)
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}

__At Tilburg University__

- Plagiarism detection (e.g., TurnItIn)
- Automatic messages (e.g., Teams)
- Voice assistants (e.g., Outlook's "play my email")
- Text editing (e.g., "Editor" in Word or Grammarly)
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
- AI is not as new as we think
- Algorithms are everywhere
- Some examples of AI applications that you may have already come across:

...many more at futurepedia.io
- Insert two slides here: one w/ a screenshot of my Vidi proposal and grammarly as a writing coach
- Another one with a screenshot of futurepedia and its large catalogue of AI applications

## How does AI work?
- Data &rarr; Model &rarr; Results

::: {.notes}
- Interact, make predictions, etc.
- Looks like a regression!

### And then came ChatGPT... {.smaller}
**What's new?**

- Specialized AI vs general-purpose AI
- Trained on massive input data (with internet connection at Bing)
- Conversational (iterative input, "creative" output)
- Language predictor model (seems to understand, but likely does not)

. . .

**How to use it?**

- Open [chat.openai.com]() 
- Login; then refresh until you're in
- Start a conversation
  - put it into the right mode ("prompting")
  - keep on talking

## ChatGPT vs. OpenAI API

- ChatGPT is "just" an interface
  - make AI better
  - get user feedback
  
- The __real__ value of AIs like OpenAI lies in its __integrative capabilities__ via APIs
  - Connect to own systems using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
  - Many AIs to come (__GPT-4__ releases [__yesterday!__](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4))
    - creativity, advanced reasoning, smart (bar exam: 90th percentile, biology: 99th)
    - used by Khan Academy (student feedback), Duolingo (conversations in foreign languages)


# 2. How is AI already <br>being used at <br>Tilburg University?{background-color="#036"}

## How is AI already being used at TiU? {.smaller}
::: goal
AI is widely experimented with by researchers and teachers across TiU.
:::

**Teaching from a teacher's perspective:**

- Generating and/or improving syllabi, lecture outlines, and exam questions
- Automation and 'stitching together' different systems
- Finding examples and case studies
- Putting subtitles on a video
- More interactions in class & more engaging slides 

**Teaching from a student's perspective:**

- Fixing or annotating computer code
- Writing and rewriting coach
- A "virtual" Hannes Datta
- Converting documents, finding jobs, and redesigning resumes

## How is AI already being used at TiU? 
**Research:**

- GitHub copilot: 80% fewer coding tasks
- Editing, proofreading, title generation
- "A helping hand": drafting ideas, generating outlines, answering emails
- Data collection and editing
- Filling in forms
- Generating stimuli
- Summarizing articles

# 3. What are new ways <br>in which we can use it?{background-color="#036"}

## Future use cases of AI at TiU {.smaller}
- **Better course content:**

  - Automatic updating of course content
  - Multimodal teaching: converting lectures into podcasts (or the other way around)
  - Personalisation of admission requirements

- **Performance assessment/testing & grading:**

  - More formative testing, generation of open questions
  - Automatic grading

- **Scheduling:**

  - Allocation of room schedules, flexibilization of education
  - Budget and time allocation

- **Personal coaching and career coaching**

## Benefits of using AI at TiU 
- Preparing students for the future job market
- Time and money savings for faculty
- Allows for investment in improving education and research

**Examples of time-saving tasks:**

- Filling in Excel sheets
- Converting between Canvas
- Automatically scheduling appointments

## Risks if TiU doesn't embrace AI
- Monetary implications: losing students to other universities
- Falling behind in research output
- Possibility of students and staff using AI illegally
- Lack of modernization of infrastructure and inability to "connect"

## Potential Drawbacks
- Laziness of employees
- Passing students who don't deserve it
- Less interaction in class
- Copying and cheating
- Quality when automating
- Ethical control
- Trustworthiness concerns
- Citation of AI-generated content


## AI roadmap for Tilburg University{.smaller}
- Embrace AI or risk becoming irrelevant
- Encourage use and experimentation by involving students and young facult
- Provide campus license of ChatGPT
- Accelerate open science to transform research climate
- Give researchers access to cloud service providers
- Build meshups, plugins
- Educate everyone on AI, from secretary to professor
- Programming classes and more
- Get infrastructure ready
- Make data open and redefine data ownership

# Conclusion{background-color="#036"}

## Conclusion {.smaller}
- Tilburg University is actively exploring the use of AI in various aspects of education and research
- AI offers numerous benefits, such as personalisation, automation, and time and cost savings
- However, there are also potential risks and drawbacks that need to be addressed, such as ethical concerns and the need for quality control
- To successfully integrate AI, Tilburg University needs to encourage use and experimentation, involve students and young faculty, educate its staff, and get its infrastructure ready
- Embracing AI is crucial for the university to stay relevant and competitive in the rapidly evolving landscape of higher education and research
