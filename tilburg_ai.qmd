## How does AI work?

Data &rarr; Model &rarr; Results

<!-- I need a better viz here-->
![<font size="2" color=grey> Data pipeline by [OVHcloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/journey-paas/ai/) </font>](img/data-pipeline.png)

::: {.notes}
- Interact, make predictions, etc.
- Looks like a regression!
:::

### And then came ChatGPT... {.smaller}
**What's new?**

- Specialized AI vs. __general-purpose__ AI
- Trained on __massive data__ (with internet connection at Bing)
- __Conversational__ (iterative input, "creative" output)
- __Language__ model (seems to understand, but likely does not)

. . .

**How to use it?**

- Open [chat.openai.com]() 
- Login & refresh until you're in
- Start a conversation!

::: {.notes}
  - Prompting (i.e., encourage to __act__ like someone or something)
  - Asking (i.e., your specific task)
  - Refinement
:::

# 2. How is AI currently used at Tilburg University?{background-color="#036"}


## How we use AI in teaching {.smaller}

- Course design and management
  - Creating and revising exam questions
  - Generating and/or improving syllabi and lecture outlines
  
- Content delivery
  - Finding examples and case studies
  - Creating and improving slides, generating video subtitles
  
- Automation
  - Semi-automated grading
  - Connect different systems


::: goal
We leverage AI to efficiently improve education through engaging, multimodal, and high-quality content.
:::

## How our students use AI {.smaller}

- Searching information (e.g., much faster than Google)
- Editor (e.g., finding good titles & writing abstracts, feedback on writing style, developing paragraph structures, synthesizing)
- Ideation and problem solving (e.g., "which `R` package to use for X?")
- Deepening knowledge, beyond the course content (e.g., "I want to learn more about X. Where to start?")
- Drafting, fixing or annotating computer code (e.g., "I have a bug in this code - do you spot it?")
- A "virtual" teacher, 24/7, immediate response (e.g., "why is X important?", "can you explain how X works?")
- Note-taking during class (e.g., voice-to-text; typing & filling in gaps)
- Preparing for the labor market (e.g., redesigning CVs)

::: notes

 (e.g. Hey chat GPT, what do you think of this letter/email in relation to its goal/objective?)
 
:::
## How we use AI in research {.smaller}

- Writing computer code (e.g., GitHub copilot)
- Editing, proofreading (e.g., cutting words)
- Knowledge discovery (e.g., background research, key references)
- Ideation (e.g., generating outlines, "how to start"?)
- Research assistant (e.g., generating stimuli, summarizing articles, transcribing interviews)
- Automation (e.g., filling in forms, answering emails)
- As a subject of research (e.g., method development, societal impact, legal landscape)

# 3. Novel applications of AI{background-color="#036"}

## Automating the use of AI {.smaller}

- API ecosystems ("linching pin" of the internet economy; e.g., Facebook, Spotify, Amazon Web Services)
- ChatGPT is "just" an interface to OpenAI's APIs (and its latest version, ["GPT-4 API"](https://openai.c
  om/product/gpt-4), was just announced yesterday)
    - creativity, advanced reasoning
    - passing percentiles: bar exam (90th), GRE quant. (80th), GRE verbal (99th)
    - already used in education: student feedback (Khan Academy), conversations in foreign languages (Duolingo)

::: goal
In __rolling out AI in Tilburg__, let's think about first applying AI __manually__ ("hey, here's an exam question - can you create 5 different versions?"), and then __automating__ successful use cases.
:::

## Future use cases {.smaller}

- Low-hanging fruits
  - Aligning course content with "blended" learning strategy (e.g., updating syllabus, introducing more interactive moments)
  - "Recycling" existing course content (old lectures) by creative cutting, format conversion, transcripting, redeveloping
  - Improving assessment (e.g., more formative testing, generation of questions)
<br>
- Challenging but possible with today's technology
  - Automating assessment (e.g., written feedback, automated grading)
  - Chat bots (e.g., student help desk, IT help desk, study coach, career coach)

<!-- Example here on automated improving of exam questions 

(TestVision &rarr; select "bad" exam questions &raar; improve them with a "good" prompt &raar; create new draft questions in TestVision &rarr; send email to teacher, informing about update and asking for review)

## Risks and opportunities {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

__Risks of embracing AI__

- ChatGPT = copying and cheating?  <!--(but: on-campus exams, "citability" of ChatGPT)-->
- "Will students still learn X?" <!--(but: more feedback, more complicated problems)-->
- Changing teaching styles and assessment <!--(but: also Powerpoint and Covid changed teaching)-->
- Quality control when scaling up<!-- (but: firms can do it, already!)-->
- Impact on staffing? <!--(but: we can redefine roles) <!-- , focus on new content and student coaching-->

<!--- Lack of trustworthiness (but: important 21st century skill to detect it!)
-->
