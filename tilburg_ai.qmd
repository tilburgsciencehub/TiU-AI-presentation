- Personalized and interdisciplinary programs

::: goal
AI technology developed by students and faculty has revolutionized higher education.
:::

# Agenda

- Researcher from TiSEM (but: involved 10+ faculty and staff members, across schools and divisions)

<!--- Focus on AI &rarr; University (not: AI &rarr; workplaces)-->

# 1. What's AI?{background-color="#036"}

## AI is everywhere

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
__In daily life__

- Search and recommendation (e.g. Bol.com)
- Face recognition (e.g., iPhone)
- Navigation (e.g., Google Maps)
- Voice assistants (e.g., Alexa)

:::

::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}

__At Tilburg University__

- Plagiarism detection (e.g., TurnItIn)
- Text editing (e.g., "Editor" in Word or Grammarly)
- Automatic messages (e.g., Teams)
- Voice assistants (e.g., Outlook's "play my email")
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
- AI is not as new as we think
- Algorithms are everywhere
- Some examples of AI applications that you may have already come across... many more at futurepedia.io

### And then came ChatGPT... {.smaller}
**What's new?**

- __General-purpose AI__ (vs. specialized AI)
- __Language__ model (*seems* to understand)
- Trained on __massive data__ (with internet connection at Bing)
- __Conversational__ (iterative input, "creative" output)

. . .

**How to use it?**

- Open [chat.openai.com]() 
- Login & refresh until you're in
- Start a conversation!

::: {.notes}
  - Prompting (i.e., encourage to __act__ like someone or something)
  - Asking (i.e., your specific task)
  - Refinement

# 2. How is AI currently used at Tilburg University?{background-color="#036"}


## How we use AI in teaching {.smaller}

- Course design and management
  - Creating and revising exam questions
  - Generating and/or improving syllabi and lecture outlines
  
- Content delivery
  - Finding examples and case studies
  - Creating and improving slides
  
- Automation
  - Connect different systems (e.g., Canvas API)
  - Semi-automated grading


::: goal
We leverage AI to efficiently improve education through engaging, multimodal, and high-quality content.
:::

## How our students use AI {.smaller}

- Searching information (e.g., much faster than Google)
- Note-taking during class (e.g., voice-to-text; typing & filling in gaps)
- Drafting, fixing or annotating computer code (e.g., "I have a bug in this code - do you spot it?")
- Ideation and problem solving (e.g., "which `R` package to use for X?")
- A "virtual" teacher, 24/7, immediate response (e.g., "why is X important?", "can you explain how X works?", "I want to learn more about X. Where to start?")
- Editor (e.g., finding good titles & writing abstracts, feedback on writing style, developing paragraph structures, synthesizing; CV writing)
- Prompt engineering (e.g., more specific goals, more context, assign role and persona, feed with information, "can you confirm?")

::: notes

 (e.g. Hey chat GPT, what do you think of this letter/email in relation to its goal/objective?)

![<font color=grey>Text editor popular among students (Quillbot)</font>](img/quillbot.png)


## How we use AI in research {.smaller}

- As a subject of research (e.g., method development, societal impact, legal landscape)
- Editing, proofreading (e.g., cutting words)
- Knowledge discovery and ideation (e.g., background research, key references, outline generation)
- Automation (e.g., filling in forms, answering emails)
- Research assistant (e.g., generating stimuli, summarizing articles, transcribing interviews)
- Writing computer code (e.g., using GitHub copilot)

# 3. Novel applications of AI{background-color="#036"}

## The "next big things" {.smaller}

**Release of GPT-4**

- latest version, ["GPT-4"](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4), was recently released
- major leap in AI: creativity, advanced reasoning
- passing percentiles: bar exam (90th), GRE quant. (80th), GRE verbal (99th)

. . .


**Integration and automation using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**

- API ecosystems ("linching pin" of the internet economy; e.g., Facebook, Spotify, ...)
- Entire functionality of ChatGPT (and more) can be programmatically accessed
- GPT-4 already used in education: student feedback (Khan Academy), conversations in foreign languages (Duolingo)

. . .

::: goal
&rarr; AIs become smarter and can be integrated, fine-tuned & automated.
:::

## Future use cases {.smaller}

- Low-hanging fruits
  - Improving assessment (e.g., more formative testing, generation of questions)
  - Aligning course content with "blended" learning strategy (e.g., updating syllabus, introducing more interactive moments)
<br><br>
- Challenging but possible with today's technology
  - Chatbots (e.g., student help desk, IT help desk, but also study & career coach)
  - Automating assessment (e.g., written feedback, automated grading)
  - "Recycling" existing course content (old lectures) by creative cutting or format conversions

<!-- Example here on automated improving of exam questions 

(TestVision &rarr; select "bad" exam questions &raar; improve them with a "good" prompt &raar; create new draft questions in TestVision &rarr; send email to teacher, informing about update and asking for review)

-->

## Risks and opportunities {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

__Risks of embracing AI__

- ChatGPT = copying and cheating?  <!--(but: on-campus exams, "citability" of ChatGPT)-->
- "Will students still learn X?" <!--(but: more feedback, more complicated problems)-->
- How to adapt teaching methods and assessment?<!--(but: also Powerpoint and Covid changed teaching)-->
- Quality checks when scaling up?<!-- (but: firms can do it, already!)-->
- Less physical interaction?
- Impact on staffing? <!--(but: we can redefine roles) <!-- , focus on new content and student coaching-->

<!--- Lack of trustworthiness (but: important 21st century skill to detect it!)
-->

__Opportunities of embracing AI__

- Using AI is relevant for our students' future and society at large
- Learning how to "use" an AI is not self-evident: that's education, too!
- Offer novel ways to deepen knowledge and foster curiosity
- Allow researchers to stay productive
- Aligns with and promotes our strategy (e.g., blended learning, taking courage )

:::

::: goal
Initial investment of time, effort, and money. But can enhance quality of education and research.

<!--
- Laziness of employees
- Less interaction in class

# 4. Making Tilburg<br>AI-ready!{background-color="#036"}

## Making Tilburg AI-ready! {.smaller}

- (1) Educate staff and faculty
  - basic use of ChatGPT & use cases
  - automation with no-coding (e.g., Power Automate) or coding tools (e.g., on Datacamp)
<br><br>
- (2) Encourage use of AI
  - campus license for ChatGPT --- promote use among staff, faculty and students
  - build a community, spanning schools and stakeholder groups, to exchange experiences

## Making Tilburg AI-ready! {.smaller}

- (3) Experiment what works (and what does not)
  - gather (and publish) empirical evidence
  - open up programmatic access to TiU infrastructure (e.g., app development)
  - automate successful prototypes (e.g., course overhaul, assessment)
<br><br>
- (4) Invest in "moonshot" projects
  - Personalization of admission requirements for courses and programs
  - "Algorithmic" and interdisciplinary study programs + blended learning
  - Real-time scheduling (including students' study rooms)
  - "Smart" budget and teaching allocation algorithms


## Conclusion {.smaller}
- Students and some faculty already explore the use of AI in education and research
- AI offers numerous benefits, but also risks that need to be addressed
- To fully leverage AI, we need a clear "AI strategy" (with goals and budget)

<br>

::: goal
Let's embrace AI with __courage__ and __curiosity__ to increase the quality of our education and research.
