## Future Vision for Universities 

- Algorithmic approach to course allocation
- Personalized studying experience
- Budget allocation to course developers and teachers
- Automated scheduling based on predicted attendance
- Summarized lectures and slide decks for otherwise engaged students
- Professors can focus on coaching and developing new ideas
- AI technology revolutionizes higher education

# Agenda & Purpose

1.  What is AI?
2.  How do we already use AI?
3.  What are new ways in which we can use it?
4.  How to get AI-ready?


## Who am I?
- Hannes Datta; Assoc. Prof at TiU for ten years since 2013
- Working in marketing, studying digital markets
- Alumnus of Tilburg Young Academy
- Lead at Tilburg Science Hub

- Focusing on university, not workplaces

# 1. What's AI <br>(and what it's not)?{background-color="#036"}

## What's AI (and what it's not)?
- AI is not as new as we think
- Algorithms are everywhere
- Some examples of AI applications that you may have already come across:
  - TurnItIn [Canvas tool for plagiarism]
  - Grammarly / Editor in Office
  - Smart email replies in Outlook, or "play my email" on mobile<br>
...many more at futurepedia.io

## How does AI work?
- Data -> Model -> Results
- Interact, make predictions, etc.
- Looks like a regression!

### ChatGPT {.smaller}
**Innovation in ChatGPT:**

- Specialized API vs general-purpose AI
- Trained on massive input data with a live connection to the internet at Bing
- Iterative input

**How to use ChatGPT:**

- Put it into a specific mode [prompting]
- Start a conversation

**Background:**

- It's a language predictor model
- Generates unexpected results

# 2. How is AI already <br>being used at <br>Tilburg University?{background-color="#036"}

## How is AI already being used at TiU? {.smaller}
::: goal
AI is widely experimented with by researchers and teachers across TiU.
:::

**Teaching from a teacher's perspective:**

- Generating and/or improving syllabi, lecture outlines, and exam questions
- Automation and 'stitching together' different systems
- Finding examples and case studies
- Putting subtitles on a video
- More interactions in class & more engaging slides 

**Teaching from a student's perspective:**

- Fixing or annotating computer code
- Writing and rewriting coach
- A "virtual" Hannes Datta
- Converting documents, finding jobs, and redesigning resumes

## How is AI already being used at TiU? 
**Research:**

- GitHub copilot: 80% fewer coding tasks
- Editing, proofreading, title generation
- "A helping hand": drafting ideas, generating outlines, answering emails
- Data collection and editing
- Filling in forms
- Generating stimuli
- Summarizing articles

# 3. What are new ways <br>in which we can use it?{background-color="#036"}

## Future use cases of AI at TiU {.smaller}
- **Better course content:**

  - Automatic updating of course content
  - Multimodal teaching: converting lectures into podcasts (or the other way around)
  - Personalisation of admission requirements

- **Performance assessment/testing & grading:**

  - More formative testing, generation of open questions
  - Automatic grading

- **Scheduling:**

  - Allocation of room schedules, flexibilization of education
  - Budget and time allocation

- **Personal coaching and career coaching**

## Benefits of using AI at TiU 
- Preparing students for the future job market
- Time and money savings for faculty
- Allows for investment in improving education and research

**Examples of time-saving tasks:**

- Filling in Excel sheets
- Converting between Canvas
- Automatically scheduling appointments

## Risks if TiU doesn't embrace AI
- Monetary implications: losing students to other universities
- Falling behind in research output
- Possibility of students and staff using AI illegally
- Lack of modernization of infrastructure and inability to "connect"

## Potential Drawbacks
- Laziness of employees
- Passing students who don't deserve it
- Less interaction in class
- Copying and cheating
- Quality when automating
- Ethical control
- Trustworthiness concerns
- Citation of AI-generated content


## AI roadmap for Tilburg University{.smaller}
- Embrace AI or risk becoming irrelevant
- Encourage use and experimentation by involving students and young facult
- Provide campus license of ChatGPT
- Accelerate open science to transform research climate
- Give researchers access to cloud service providers
- Build meshups, plugins
- Educate everyone on AI, from secretary to professor
- Programming classes and more
- Get infrastructure ready
- Make data open and redefine data ownership

# Conclusion{background-color="#036"}

## Conclusion {.smaller}
- Tilburg University is actively exploring the use of AI in various aspects of education and research
- AI offers numerous benefits, such as personalisation, automation, and time and cost savings
- However, there are also potential risks and drawbacks that need to be addressed, such as ethical concerns and the need for quality control
- To successfully integrate AI, Tilburg University needs to encourage use and experimentation, involve students and young faculty, educate its staff, and get its infrastructure ready
- Embracing AI is crucial for the university to stay relevant and competitive in the rapidly evolving landscape of higher education and research
